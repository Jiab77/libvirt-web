# libVirt Web

A simple web interface based on [libVirt](https://libvirt.org/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/).

## Installation

The installation process is pretty simple and will require only few dependencies.

The web interface should be able to run on desktops and servers.

## Dependencies

There is only few dependencies required:

1. `libvirt-bin` (The `virsh` command should be provided by [libVirt](https://libvirt.org/))
2. `virt-viewer`
3. `virt-install`
4. `libguestfs`
5. `php-cli`
6. `php-gd`
7. `php-xml`
8. `php-json`

> I have dropped the ImageMagick `convert` command from dependencies.

## Plaforms

The project has been tested on [Pop_OS!](https://system76.com/pop), a Linux distribution based on [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes).

It is also tested on FreeBSD by my friend [@Sevendogs5](https://twitter.com/Sevendogs5).

### Ubuntu and derivated distribs

You should only need to install these packages:

```bash
# For desktop
sudo apt install libvirt-bin virt-viewer virtinst libguestfs-tools php-cli php-gd php-xml php-json

# For server
sudo apt install libvirt-bin virtinst libguestfs-tools php-cli php-gd php-xml php-json

# For PHP < 7.4
sudo apt install ucspi-tcp
```

> I still need to validate the packages list so this might change later.

### FreeBSD

Instruction will be provided soon.

## Run the web interface

You can run the web interface by using the embedded web server from `PHP` or using `apache` or `nginx`.

### PHP Embedded Web Server

You can start the server that way:

```bash
cd libvirt-web
./start-local-server.sh
```

> `sudo` is not required to run the server. It is required only if you want to run the server on a port below **1024**.
>
> You can also choose any other ports than **8000**.

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your internet browser.

> I'm using Chromium but it should work on any other modern browser.

### Apache / nginx

This setup is not tested yet and will be documented later.

## Breaking Changes

I've changed completely the project structure and now the code is splitted into several files instead of keeping everything into a single file.

The more I was adding features and cleaner logic, the more it became difficult to maintain and keep it readable and understandable.

So the best solution that came to me was split the single file into several ones, now it's much more easier to maintain the project.

A single file version still exist if you look at the file `libvirtweb.aio.php` but it will not be supported anymore.

## Missing / Not Working

Here will be listed missing features / those not working correctly.

* Remote connection on VM's using `virt-viewer`.
  * Works on local only...
* Connection to remote hypervisor.
  * Not implemented yet / not correctly...
* ISO image upload.
  * The upload is working but the uploaded file can't be moved to `/var/lib/libvirt/images`...
  * This is due to access restricted to `sudoers` with filesystem permissions.
* Graphics are still missing.

## Thanks

Thanks to the respective developers for their amazing work.

Huge thanks to [Ingmar Decker](http://www.webdecker.de) for the `PPM` Image Reader `PHP` class.

Also thanks to my friend [@Sevendogs5](https://twitter.com/Sevendogs5) for supporting the FreeBSD platform.
